  name: Ivan Levitsky
  biography: Ivan Levitsky, pseudonym of Ivan Nechuy-levitsky, also spelled Nechúi-levýtsky,
    or Nečuj-levycʾkyj (born Nov. 25 [Nov. 13, old style], 1838, Steblev, Kiev province,
    Ukraine, Russian Empire—died April 15 [April 2, O.S.], 1918, Kiev), Ukrainian
    Realist novelist of the postserfdom reform period. He drew upon his background
    as a seminary student and, later, a provincial teacher, to depict the educated
    and lower classes in some of the earliest social novels in Ukrainian literature.
    His works include Prichepa (1869; “The Intruder”), Khmari (1874; “Clouds”), Kaydasheva
    semya (1879; “The Kaydashev Family”), and Burlachka (1881; “A Factory Girl”).
    Use of objective narrative and details of folklore strengthen the realistic effect
    of his works.
